<h1>I'm also pretty sure computers are actually magic</h1>

<p><strong>Check out my board gaming site I made for fun/practice: <a href="https://table-topper.herokuapp.com/">Table Topper</a></strong></p>

<p>
I like computers, I like programming, I like mathematics, and I sure love coffee.
</p>

<p>
This site is sort of a conglomeration of things, from GitHub repos to posts about my learning of machine algorithms to talks about the latest sumo wrestling tournament (check that out!)
</p>

And probably pictures of my cat at some point.

Hopefully over time this site will provide either encouragement or entertainment to someone out there, and if it does then it has done its job.

<p>
Happy coding/gaming/integrating/sumoing!
