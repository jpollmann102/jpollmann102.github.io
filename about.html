<h1>About Me</h1>
<div class="image-cropper">
    <img src="/assets/images/dasme.jpg" class="rounded"/>
    <div>
      <p>
      Currently entering my last semester of college pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science at the University of Central Florida.
      </p>
      <p>
      Programming for the last 6 or so years, my strengths include Java and C, with interests in big data and machine learning.
      </p>
      <p>
      My recent programming research and practice has been in React applications using Recharts to create graphs for big data pertaining to my senior design project. Outside of school I have been interested in song lyric generation from RNN algorithms based on the discographies of my favorite artists, as well as sports predictions using ML.
      </p>
      <p>
      Outside of programming, I'm a huge basketball fan, I play a LOT of Rocket League, and I follow sumo wrestling religiously.
      </p>
      <p>
      Just taking things one day at a time, learning as I go to try and be the best programmer and person I can be.
