<h1>About Me</h1>
<div class="image-cropper">
    <img src="/assets/images/dasme.jpg" class="rounded"/>
    <div>
      <p>
      Graduated in 2019 from the University of Central Florida with a B.S. in Computer Science. Currently work at Walt Disney World in Orlando, FL.
      </p>
      <p>
      Programming for the last 7 or so years, my strengths include JavaScript, and Python, with interests in big data, UI design and programming with Angular, and machine learning.
      </p>
      <p>
      For the past year and a half I have been making magic with Disney, mainly doing Python scripting and Angular development. In college, I worked on my senior design project, working with big data to create visualizations for soundscape ecology researchers (also on my repos page.)
      </p>
      <p>
      Outside of programming, I'm a huge basketball fan, I play a lot of Rocket League and Overwatch, I'm really into board games, and I follow sumo wrestling religiously.
      </p>
      <p>
      Just taking things one day at a time, learning as I go to try and be the best programmer and person I can be.
