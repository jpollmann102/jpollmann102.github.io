<h1>About Me</h1>

    <div>
      <p>
      Graduated in 2019 from the University of Central Florida with a B.S. in Computer Science. Currently working at Walt Disney World in Orlando, FL.
      </p>
      <p>
      Programming for the last 9 or so years, my strengths include JavaScript and Angular in web development, and Python scripting. My programming interests are in big data, UI design/implementation, and machine learning/AI.
      </p>
      <p>
      For over three years I have been making magic with Disney, mainly doing full stack web development with Angular and Express/NodeJS. In college my senior design project had me focusing on big data organization and visualization for soundscape ecology researchers (check it out on my repos page).
      </p>
      <p>
        More recently, I've been working a site over at <a href="https://protechsign.com">ProTechSign</a> for generating secure signature cards for business documents. This project has taught me so much about software product design and using Firebase and Google Cloud Platform which I am now a major fan of.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm also working on a site with Angular and Firebase for keeping track of gift ideas and your friends/loved ones' birthdays and anniversaries. Coming soon!
      </p>
      <p>
      Outside of programming, I'm a huge basketball and football fan (including fantasy), I play a variety of video games on PC PlayStation and Switch, I'm really into board games, and I follow sumo wrestling.
      </p>
      <p>
      Just taking things one day at a time, learning as I go to try and be the best programmer and person I can be.
