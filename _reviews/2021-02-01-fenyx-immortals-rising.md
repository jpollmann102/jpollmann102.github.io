excerpt: A great Breathlike (is that a thing now?) with a really engaging story for Greek mythology lovers and novices alike
---
Immortals Fenyx Rising is considered by most to be a Breath of the Wild clone, which as far as I know (maybe aside from Genshin Impact from what I hear) is the first of its kind to work off of the 2017 masterpiece's formula.

If that is the case, I think it does a great job at presenting an engaging and surprisingly funny story based around Greek mythology, with loads of collectibles and puzzles to keep players around for dozens of hours.

## The Story
The gist of Immortals Fenyx Rising is that the titan Typhon has emerged from his prison to wreak havoc on the Golden Isles, a mythical island created by the inventor Daedulus. Typhon has turned all the mortals on the island to stone, aside from the main character Fenyx. It is now up to Fenyx to help Hermes restore the essences to Athena, Haephestus, Ares, and Aphrodite in order to put a stop to Typhon. Along the way, Fenyx will learn intimate details of the Gods' relationships with eachother and their father Zeus, while solving puzzles and collecting resources to become a hero for the ages.

## Zeus Sucks?
Without too much spoilers, for those of you who aren't too versed in Greek mythology, turns out Zeus *sucks*.

Through out the game's story you'll hear from the four Gods you'll be freeing, Haephestus, Athena, Ares, and Aphrodite. You'll also be interacting with Hermes a lot, who will be your hub world host and will also accompany you on certain mission cut scenes. In each of their stories, they explain their insecurities that stemmed from how Zeus has treated them in the past, and how these insecurities have manifested into their current situations. It really was a sometimes sombering story in an otherwise happy game.

I also just want to say that Haephestus' story in particular is especially sad and I feel the worst for him. Even at the end of the game when things seem to be looking up, Haephestus is still getting the shortest end of an already small stick. Poor guy.

## Prometheus
The game's narrative is explained through a story that Prometheus is telling Zeus, in exchange for Prometheus' freedom from his chains. When exploring and discovering different places or solving puzzles, Zeus and Prometheus will exchange banter as it relates to the Greek myth or story accompanying what you are doing. Often times, these exchanges are pretty funny, with Zeus' personality really shining through his not so great attributes and actions. Prometheus also plays an essential role in the game's conclusion, in what I thought was a very original and interesting ending.

## Conclusion
Overall, I really enjoyed my time with Fenyx. At no point did I want to rush the story to finish it so I can move on. I went and collected everything I could, completed all the puzzles, constellations, and chests I found, and did almost all of the "dungeons." At the end, I was so powerful the final encounter was pretty easy. But, that didn't take away from the experience due to a little help with some friends made along the way.
