excerpt: This is a post about my cat, Pickle.

I got Pickle in July of last year (2020), I guess you could call him my quarantine cat.

He is quite the bundle of energy, and he very quickly goes between zoomies and head butts.

He also does this thing that I find very creepy, he chatters at light reflections on walls, it is very strange. Picture below.

Pickle is best buds with my other cat Toulouse (otherwise known as Chungus) who is pictured below.

I also made a Discord bot that is on my Github that will post pictures of him when you type !piggle or !pickle. [Pickle Bot](https://github.com/jpollmann102/pickle-bot)
