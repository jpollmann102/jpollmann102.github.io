excerpt: Predictions for the NFL playoffs Wildcard round
---

I managed to get my model up to 72% accuracy with logistic regression and around 63% accuracy in my NN model. So, not too great with the NN but decent with regression. The picks are as follows:

### Logistic Model
Indianapolis Colts    51.8%, Houston Texans        48.2%

Seattle Seahawks      67.7%, Dallas Cowboys        32.3%

Los Angeles Chargers  52.0%, Baltimore Ravens      48.0%

Philadelphia Eagles   23.5%, Chicago Bears         76.5%

### NN Model
Indianapolis Colts    71.6%, Houston Texans        28.4%

Seattle Seahawks      33.2%, Dallas Cowboys        66.8%

Los Angeles Chargers  81.2%, Baltimore Ravens      18.8%

Philadelphia Eagles   42.5%, Chicago Bears         57.5%

### My Predictions
To be completely honest I don't follow football a whole lot. Basketball is my thing (which I'm working on also predicting.) However I do partake a bit in fantasy football so I've become a bit more versed in which teams are good at what, so these are my inexperienced picks to win:

Colts, Seahawks, Chargers, Bears
